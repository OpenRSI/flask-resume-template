          <p align="justify">
            I worked for two years in an investment bank, and I completed
            multiple internships in various financial companies, such as a
            broker and an asset manager. However, I realized that I was more
            interested in technology and wanted to specialize in that field.
            That's why I went back to school to learn how to code and become a
            professional programmer.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Before, I would only code here and there as a hobby, but now I have
            been coding extensively for many hours every day and dedicated to
            learning and improving my skills as a programmer. I am excited to
            see where my new passion will take me.

                I studied at school 42 because it is a unique institution that
                offers a singular education model. At school 42, the focus is on
                project-based learning and problem-solving, rather than
                traditional classroom instruction and exams.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                This allows students to learn practical skills and apply them in
                real-world situations. In addition to the hands-on learning
                experience, school 42 also has a strong emphasis on peer-to-peer
                learning. This means that students are encouraged to collaborate
                and learn from each other, which helps to create a supportive
                and inclusive learning environment.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">
                During my time at school 42, I learned a wide range of skills,
                including programming, data analysis, and critical thinking. I
                also had the opportunity to work on various projects, including
                developing a web application and participating in a hackathon.
                Overall, my experience at school 42 was extremely rewarding and
                has prepared me well for the challenges of the workforce. I am
                grateful for the unique education I received and the skills I
                developed during my time there.
