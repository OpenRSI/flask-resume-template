# flask-resume-template

visit the website : https://ddordain.pythonanywhere.com/

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Flask for the backend.

To run the project locally, you will need to have Flask installed on your machine. If you do not have Flask installed, you can install it by running the following command:

```shell
pip install flask
```

then start the server running flask. 

This will start the server and you should see a message indicating that the server is running at a specific address (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000/). You can then open this address in your web browser to view the online CV.

If you make any changes to the code, you will need to stop and restart the server in order for the changes to take effect / or you need to modify the line 6 of the main.py
```py
app.run(debug=True)
```


In the HTML, you will find the structure of the page, including the layout and the content. The CSS is used to style the page, including the layout, font, and colors. The JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the page, such as handling form submissions or updating content dynamically.
